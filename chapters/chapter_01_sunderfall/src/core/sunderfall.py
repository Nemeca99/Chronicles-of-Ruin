"""
CHRONICLES OF RUIN: SUNDERFALL - MAIN GAME ENGINE
==================================================

This is the main entry point and director for the Chronicles of Ruin game system.
Players interact exclusively with this file - all other modules are imported and
coordinated through this central engine.

PURPOSE:
- Main game loop and state management
- Coordinates all other modules (classes, combat, items, etc.)
- Handles player input and game flow
- Manages save/load functionality
- Provides the primary interface for players

ARCHITECTURE:
- Imports all other modules as needed
- Acts as the "director" that orchestrates gameplay
- Maintains the main game state
- Routes player actions to appropriate modules
- Handles the core game loop (explore, combat, inventory, etc.)

USAGE:
- Players run this file to start the game
- All other files are implementation details
- This file should never need to be modified by players
- All game logic is delegated to specialized modules

MODULE DEPENDENCIES:
- class.py: Character classes and archetypes
- archetype.py: The 4 main archetype systems
- status_elemental.py: Status effects and elemental mechanics
- combat.py: Combat calculations and mechanics
- items.py: Item system and custom sets
- player.py: Player progression and stats
- skills.py: Skill trees and abilities

GAME FLOW:
1. Initialize game state and load modules
2. Present main menu to player
3. Handle character creation/loading
4. Main game loop (explore, combat, inventory, etc.)
5. Save game state when appropriate

This file serves as the "brain" of the entire game system, coordinating
all other components while providing a clean interface for players.

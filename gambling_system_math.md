# Chronicles of Ruin - Gambling System Mathematics

## **üìä DAMAGE CALCULATION FORMULAS**

### **Step 1: Base Damage Calculation**

```
Base Damage = (All Positive Bonuses) - (All Negative Bonuses)
```

**Example:**

- Power: +8 damage
- Weapon: +12 damage
- Skill: +5 damage
- Cursed Ring: -3 damage
- Debuff: -2 damage

**Calculation:**

```
Positive: 8 + 12 + 5 = 25
Negative: 3 + 2 = 5
Base Damage = 25 - 5 = 20
```

### **Step 2: Apply Percentage Modifiers**

```
Modified Damage = Base Damage √ó (1 + Total Percentage Bonuses)
```

**Example:**

- Base Damage: 20
- Fire Damage: +15%
- Weapon Enchant: +10%
- Set Bonus: +25%

**Calculation:**

```
Total Percentage = 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.25 = 0.50 (50%)
Modified Damage = 20 √ó (1 + 0.50) = 20 √ó 1.50 = 30
```

### **Step 3: Combat Triangle Multiplier**

```
Final Damage = Modified Damage √ó Triangle Multiplier
```

**Example:**

- Modified Damage: 30
- Melee vs Ranged: +25% bonus

**Calculation:**

```
Final Damage = 30 √ó 1.25 = 37.5
```

### **Complete Example:**

```
Your stats: 2+3-1+5-3+8-1
Positive: 2+3+5+8 = 18
Negative: 1+3+1 = 5
Base: 18-5 = 13

With +20% gear bonus:
Modified: 13 √ó 1.20 = 15.6

Against weak enemy (+25%):
Final: 15.6 √ó 1.25 = 19.5 damage
```

## **üé∞ GAMBLING TAX SYSTEM**

### **Base Reroll Cost Formula**

```
Base Cost = 100 √ó Number of Pieces
```

**Examples:**

- 2-piece set: 200 gold
- 4-piece set: 400 gold
- 6-piece set: 600 gold
- 10-piece set: 1,000 gold

### **Escalation Multiplier**

```
Escalation Cost = Base Cost √ó (2^Reroll Count)
```

**6-Piece Set Example:**

- Reroll #1: 600 √ó (2^0) = 600 √ó 1 = **600 gold**
- Reroll #2: 600 √ó (2^1) = 600 √ó 2 = **1,200 gold**
- Reroll #3: 600 √ó (2^2) = 600 √ó 4 = **2,400 gold**
- Reroll #4: 600 √ó (2^3) = 600 √ó 8 = **4,800 gold**
- Reroll #5: 600 √ó (2^4) = 600 √ó 16 = **9,600 gold**

### **Gambling Tax Per Piece**

```
Each Reroll Adds: 0.001% to 0.01% tax per piece
Tax Range: 0.00001 to 0.0001 (as decimal)
```

**Random Tax Examples:**

- Helmet: +0.0034%
- Chest: +0.0078%
- Gloves: +0.0012%
- Boots: +0.0056%
- Weapon: +0.0089%
- Shield: +0.0023%

### **Total Tax Calculation**

```
Total Tax = Sum of all piece taxes
Tax Multiplier = 1 + Total Tax
Final Cost = Escalation Cost √ó Tax Multiplier
```

### **Complete Gambling Example**

**"Fire Lord's Regalia" - 6-piece set:**

**Initial State:**

- Base Cost: 600 gold
- Gambling Tax: 0% on all pieces

**After 1st Reroll:**

- Escalation: 600 √ó 2^1 = 1,200 gold
- New taxes applied:
  - Helmet: +0.0045%
  - Chest: +0.0067%
  - Gloves: +0.0023%
  - Boots: +0.0034%
  - Weapon: +0.0089%
  - Shield: +0.0012%
- Total Tax: 0.0270% = 0.00027
- **Cost: 1,200 √ó 1.00027 = 1,200.32 gold**

**After 2nd Reroll:**

- Escalation: 600 √ó 2^2 = 2,400 gold
- Additional taxes:
  - Helmet: 0.0045% + 0.0056% = 0.0101%
  - Chest: 0.0067% + 0.0078% = 0.0145%
  - Gloves: 0.0023% + 0.0034% = 0.0057%
  - Boots: 0.0034% + 0.0067% = 0.0101%
  - Weapon: 0.0089% + 0.0045% = 0.0134%
  - Shield: 0.0012% + 0.0089% = 0.0101%
- Total Tax: 0.0639% = 0.000639
- **Cost: 2,400 √ó 1.000639 = 2,401.53 gold**

**After 5th Reroll:**

- Escalation: 600 √ó 2^5 = 19,200 gold
- Accumulated taxes (example):
  - Total Tax: ~0.25% = 0.0025
- **Cost: 19,200 √ó 1.0025 = 19,248 gold**

**After 10th Reroll:**

- Escalation: 600 √ó 2^10 = 614,400 gold
- Accumulated taxes (example):
  - Total Tax: ~1.2% = 0.012
- **Cost: 614,400 √ó 1.012 = 621,773 gold**

## **‚ö†Ô∏è THE GAMBLING TRAP**

### **Psychological Escalation**

Players will experience this progression:

1. **"Just 600 gold? Easy!"** ‚úÖ
2. **"1,200 isn't bad for better bonuses..."** ü§î
3. **"2,400 is steep but I'm invested now..."** üò¨
4. **"4,800?! But I've already spent 4,000..."** üò∞
5. **"One more roll, it HAS to be good!"** üé∞
6. **"I'm broke but the taxes keep growing..."** üí∏

### **Sunk Cost Fallacy**

The exponential cost + permanent taxes create perfect conditions for gambling addiction:

- Each failed reroll makes the next one more expensive
- Players feel they "must" continue to justify previous spending
- The permanent tax means switching sets feels like "losing" all that investment

### **The Tax Visualization**

```
Set: "Nemeca's Fire Build"
Rerolls: 7
Current Cost: 77,161 gold

Gambling Taxes:
  Helmet: +0.0234%
  Chest: +0.0456%
  Gloves: +0.0123%
  Boots: +0.0345%
  Weapon: +0.0567%
  Shield: +0.0189%

Total Tax: +0.1914%
Next Reroll: 154,553 gold
```

This creates the perfect **"just one more roll"** mentality while the taxes grow forever! üòà

## **THE COMBAT TRIANGLE - ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS ON STEROIDS!** üéØ

### **The Core Philosophy**
Think of this as chess, but with more explosions and less waiting around. Every archetype has a **natural predator** and a **natural prey**. It's not just about raw power - it's about **SMARTS!**

#### **Melee > Ranged > Magic > Melee**
- **Melee vs Ranged**: "Oh, you like shooting arrows? How about I SHOVE THIS SWORD DOWN YOUR THROAT!" üó°Ô∏è
- **Ranged vs Magic**: "Your fancy spells are cute, but can they dodge THIS?" üèπ
- **Magic vs Melee**: "Your armor is impressive. Too bad lightning doesn't care about steel!" ‚ö°

#### **Wild - The Chaotic Wildcard**
Wild is the **mad scientist** of combat - unpredictable, dangerous, and absolutely **GLORIOUS** when it works! They don't follow the rules because they **MAKE** the rules!

### **Damage Calculation - The Math That Makes You Feel Like a God!** üìä

#### **Base Damage Formula**
```
Final Damage = (Base Skill Damage + Weapon Bonus + Attribute Bonus) √ó Combat Triangle Modifier √ó Percentage Bonuses
```

**Translation**: You hit like a truck, then multiply it by how much you're dominating your opponent, then add ALL the bonuses you've stacked up like a madman!

#### **Combat Triangle Modifiers**
- **Advantage**: +25% damage (You're in your element, baby!)

- **Neutral**: Normal damage (Fair fight - may the best warrior win!)

#### **The Beautiful Chaos of Wild**
